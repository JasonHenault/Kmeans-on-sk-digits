# kNN on sklearn's digits
The goal of this notepad is to clustering sklearn's digits.
To do that, I make a dimensional reduction using the tSNE algorithme given 2 components.
After that, I use k-means clustering on this projection.
The final score isn't great (about 0.5) but demonstrate the faisability of this method to recognize characters.
